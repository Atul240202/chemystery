# Chemystery
I have developed this project chemystery in which I had integrated Ramayana with modern Chemistry to make it easier for students to learn chemistry by co-relating it with story line of **Ramayana**.<br />
I have made this project mainly using Java script and hosted it on Firebase. Tis repository doesn't contain all the media files due to storage limitation by Github <br />
Link to the project: [Chemystery](https://mystery-in-chemistry.web.app/) <br />
**This project was selected for Grand Finale in Toycathon (Digital Edition) which is a Initiative under Aatma Nirbhar Bharat**

I will be further optimising this project and adding some more back-end functionalities.


## Lets talk about its structure:

> 1. [CSS](https://github.com/Atul240202/chemystery/tree/main/css): It consist all the CSS styling pages associated with all the HTML pages.
> 2.  
 

**Glimpse of my another project which I have recently devloped using Python and ROS: [Automated Warehouse System](https://youtu.be/TlbcVwzJQZk).** <br />
