# chemystery
I have developed this project chemystery in which I had integrated Ramayana with modern Chemistry to make it easier for students to learn chemistry by co-relating it with story line of Ramayana.
I have made this project mainly using Java scrippt and hosted it on Firebase. Tis repository doesn't contain all the media files due to storage limitation by Github
Link to the project: https://mystery-in-chemistry.web.app/

I will be further optimising this project and adding some more back-end functionalities.
