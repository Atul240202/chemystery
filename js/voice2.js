The Yuddha Kandam narrates the Ramayana War between the army of Rama and the army of Ravana. Having received Hanumans report on Sita, Rama and Lakshmana proceed with their allies towards the shore of the southern sea. There they are joined by Ravanas renegade brother Vibhishana. But they encounter an obstacle on their path. There is a sea they have to cross to reach their destination that is Sri Lanka'
